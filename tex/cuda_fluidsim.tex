\section{Technologies} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This project was developed on a Linux/Debian machine with a NVIDIA RTX 3060 GPU. There is no guarantee that the source code will be compatible
with other systems. Appropriate modifications may need to be performed in order to build this project on other systems.

The main driver of this project is the NVIDIA CUDA library, the version information for CUDA nvcc compiler is as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
    $ nvcc --version
    nvcc: NVIDIA (R) Cuda compiler driver
    Copyright (c) 2005-2022 NVIDIA Corporation
    Built on Mon_Oct_24_19:12:58_PDT_2022
    Cuda compilation tools, release 12.0, V12.0.76
    Build cuda_12.0.r12.0/compiler.31968024_0
\end{verbatim}

OpenCV was used to render visual representations of fluid calculations and to provide iteractivity for the user. The version information is
presented below:

\begin{verbatim}
    OpenCV version : 3.2.0
    Major version : 3
    Minor version : 2
    Subminor version : 0
\end{verbatim}

The machine that executes the simulation does not need a desktop environment. X-Forwarding may be used to project visual renders on a client
machine.

\section{Data Structures} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The scope of this project will only deal with a 2-dimensional field for fluid simulation. The data structures are defined tailored to 2-dimensions,
however the code may be modified to accommodate 3-dimensions. These data structures are desinged with the CUDA architecture in mind, to simplify
the development process and to provide an optimization to processing.

Three types of datastructures are used:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Vector Field Matrix
    \item Scalar Field Matrix
    \item BGRA Matrix
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Vector Field Matrix}
The Vector Field Matrix is represented as multidimensions array in memory. The allocation of this matrix is equivalent to the following declaration:
\begin{center}
    \begin{verbatim}
        float v_field[y-dim][x-dim][2]
    \end{verbatim}
\end{center}
In this declaration, \verb|y-dim| and \verb|x-dim| are the number of elements in the $y$ (rows) and $x$ (column) dimensions in terms of pixels, respectively.
The \verb|2| constant represents the individual vector component for each pixel the 0-index is x-component and 1-index is the y-component.

This would be represented in memory as follows:
\begin{center}
    $v\_field = \begin{bmatrix}
        (0.0,0.0) & (0.0,0.0) & (0.0, 0.0)\\
        (0.0,0.0) & (0.0,0.0) & (0.0, 0.0)\\
        (0.0,0.0) & (2.0,3.0) & (0.0, 0.0)\\
    \end{bmatrix}$
\end{center}

In this example, accessing the following indices in C would the following:
\begin{center}
    \begin{verbatim}
        v_field[2][1][0] -> 2.0
        v_field[2][1][1] -> 3.0
    \end{verbatim}
\end{center}

Deriving the array index given an x and y coordinate and vector component index is as follows:
\begin{equation}
    index = (y * x_{dim} + x) * 2 + CI_{vector}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Scalar Field Matrix}
The Scalar Field Matrix is similar to the Vector Field Matrix. The declaration of this data structure is more straightforward to its vector counterpart:
\begin{verbatim}
    float s_field[y-dim][x-dim]
\end{verbatim}
Deriving the array index given an x and y coordinate is as follows:
\begin{equation}
    index = y * x_{dim} + x
\end{equation}
    
\subsection{BGRA}
The BGRA (Blue-Green-Red-Alpha) Matrix is a representation of color channel intensities for each pixel. In OpenCV, each channel is represented
an an octet byte, where \verb|0x00| is the minimal intensity and \verb|0xFF| is the maximum.

For the designed architecture, a little-endian system is used. The byte order for every pixel is arranged as follows:
\begin{center}
    \begin{verbatim}
        pixel = 0xAARRGGBB
    \end{verbatim}
\end{center}

For rendering Vector Field Matrices, the following conversions are used for each pixel/vector coordinate:

\begin{equation}
    CH_{red} = \begin{cases}
        0xFF * |V_x|, & \text{if}\ |V_x| < 1 \\
        0xFF, & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    CH_{blue} = \begin{cases}
        0xFF * |V_y|, & \text{if}\ |V_y| < 1 \\
        0xFF, & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

For rendering Vector Field Matrices, the following conversions are used for each pixel/scalar coordinate:

\begin{equation}
    CH_{red} = \begin{cases}
        0xFF * S, & \text{if}\ S > 0 \\
        0x0, & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    CH_{blue} = \begin{cases}
        0xFF * |S|, & \text{if}\ S < 0 \\
        0x0, & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\section{Algorithms} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The main computation of this project is based off the Navier-Stokes Equations for Incompressible Flow:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\delta \vb{u}}{\delta t} = - (\vb{u} \dotproduct \grad)\vb{u} - \frac{1}{p}\grad p + v \grad^2 \vb{u} + \vb{F}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \grad \dotproduct \vb{u} = 0
\end{equation}

This report will not go in-depth of the derivation and implementation of these equations, as these are expressed in the whitepaper presented in
\begin{center}
    \href{https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems/part-vi-beyond-triangles/chapter-38-fast-fluid-dynamics-simulation-gpu}{GPU GEMS - Chapter 38}
\end{center}

The simulator will initialize multiple buffers at the beginning of the application. All buffers are \verb|memset| to zero:
\begin{verbatim}
    float *d_vfield, *h_vfield; // Device/Host Velocity Vector Field Matrices
    float *d_dfield, *h_dfield; // Device/Host Divergence Scalar Field Matrices
    float *d_pfield, *h_pfield; // Device/Host Pressure Scalar Field Matrices
    
    unsigned int *h_vbgr, *d_vbgr; // Device/Host Velocity BGR Field Matrices
    unsigned int *h_dbgr, *d_dbgr; // Device/Host Divergence BGR Field Matrices
    unsigned int *h_pbgr, *d_pbgr; // Device/Host Pressure BGR Field Matrices
\end{verbatim}

The \verb|kernel_*| functions are the device entry points for GPU operations. For every processing frame, the following operations occur:

\begin{verbatim}
|    Compute Advection by performing kernel_advect()
|        on d_vfield
|
|    Compute Divergence by performing kernel_divergence()
|        on d_vfield with output d_dfield
|
|    Compute Pressure using the following operations:
|    |    Zero-out d_pfield
|    |    For n number of iterations:
|    |    |    perform kernel_sboundary() on d_pfield
|    |    |    perform kernel_jacobi() on input d_dfield with output d_pfield
|    |    EndFor
|    EndOperation
|
|    Compute Velocity Boundaries by performing kernel_vboundary() on d_vfield
|    
|    Subtract the pressure gradient from velocity by performing kernel_gradient()
|        on input d_pfield and output d_vfield
|
|    Convert the Velocity, Divergence and Pressure Fields to the BGR representations
|        and render to screen.
|
|    Detect Mouse Click, pulse the velocity field at the mouse coordinate
\end{verbatim}

When invoking kernel calls, the dimensionality of the CUDA block/grids are defined as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
    dim3 DIM_BLOCK(32, 32);
    dim3 DIM_GRID(
        (DIMENSIONS.x + DIM_BLOCK.x - 1) / DIM_BLOCK.x,
        (DIMENSIONS.y + DIM_BLOCK.y - 1) / DIM_BLOCK.y);
\end{verbatim}

The block dimension of 32 by 32 is determined by the CUDA architecture, it is the maximum number of threads per block at the time or writing.
By allocating the grid dimensions to accommodate the block and resolution dimensions, the kernel function may determine the matrix coordinates
using the following operations:

\begin{verbatim}
    const size_t x = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    const size_t y = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
\end{verbatim}

The \verb|x| and \verb|y| variables above corresponds directly to the coordinates in Vector/Scalar/BGR Field space.

\section{Limitations} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Due to time constants, the following features were unable to be implemented at the tim of writing:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ink Flow
    \item Vorticity
\end{itemize}

This project may be re-visited in the future, should the interest arise.
